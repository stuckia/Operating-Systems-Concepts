Running the balancer without the nano-sleep reduced the amount of fighting for control of the semaphores.
Rather than threads all reaching for semaphores at once, the output demonstrates a sequential process of executing one thread at a time.
This is a direct result of there being no break between threads when they post semaphores and loop back around to trywait.
When switching between threads, it is easier for the last "focused" thread to reach control of the semaphores because the memory address was most recently accessed.
While it is a miniscule amount of time to a human, that time difference is enough to allow that thread to continue to retrieve the semaphores before the other threads get the opportunity, sending them into a cycle of waiting their turns.
Nanosleep is vital to ensure that each thread gets the opportunity to retrieve or attempt retrieval of resources.
